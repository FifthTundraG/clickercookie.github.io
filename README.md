Have you ever wanted to play a mediocre web game about clicking a cookie that has totally never been done before?

You have?!? <br>
Great!

Featuring 7 original buildings, semi-functional Javascript, and temporary pixel art images, Clicker Cookie is an uncompleted masterpiece!

## Getting Started
The game is available at [clickercookie.github.io](https://clickercookie.github.io), and can be played with no setup necessary. If you discover a bug (you probably will), please create a new issue. To play on the beta version, click the version number in the bottom left of the window.

## Contributing
### Dependencies
There are no dependencies, just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
### Running
To run the game, a local web server must be created. You can do this through various methods, but some of the common ways of doing it are using NodeJS `npx serve` or the Live Server VSCode extension. **Opening `index.html` through File Explorer will not work.**
